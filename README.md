## Association Rules Mining (Market Basket Analysis)
This repository contains a Python implementation of Association Rule Mining, specifically focusing on Market Basket Analysis, using the Apriori algorithm. The objective is to identify interesting relationships and patterns between products frequently purchased together in a retail dataset.

Project Structure
Association Rules.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the complete Python code for data preprocessing, applying the Apriori algorithm, generating association rules, and analyzing the results.

Association Rules.docx: A Microsoft Word document outlining the assignment objective, dataset details, data preprocessing steps, association rule mining techniques, and interpretation guidelines. It also includes a section with interview questions related to association rules.

Online retail.xlsx - Sheet1.csv: The dataset used for this analysis. This file likely contains transactional data from an online retail store.

Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:

To introduce rule mining techniques, particularly focusing on market basket analysis.

To provide hands-on experience in implementing association rules.

To discover interesting relationships between products purchased together using the Apriori algorithm.

To analyze and interpret the generated rules to provide insights into customer purchasing behavior.

Technologies Used
Python

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

mlxtend: For TransactionEncoder and apriori algorithm, and association_rules generation.

Data Preprocessing
The Association Rules.ipynb notebook includes steps for data preprocessing to ensure the dataset is suitable for association rule mining. This typically involves:

Handling missing values.

Removing duplicate entries.

Converting the data into a transactional format (list of lists of items).

One-hot encoding the transactional data using TransactionEncoder.

Association Rule Mining
The core of this project involves applying the Apriori algorithm to the pre-processed dataset.

Apriori Algorithm: Used to find frequent itemsets. A min_support threshold is applied to filter out infrequent itemsets.

Association Rule Generation: Rules are generated from the frequent itemsets based on confidence and lift metrics.

Thresholds: Appropriate thresholds for support, confidence, and lift are set to extract meaningful rules.

Analysis and Interpretation
The generated association rules are analyzed to identify significant patterns. The notebook provides an interpretation of key rules, including:

High Lift Rules: Highlighting rules with lift values greater than 2.0, indicating strong positive associations.

Specific Item Combinations: Discussing interesting combinations such as "Ground Beef, Herb & Pepper", "Mineral Water, Spaghetti, Ground Beef", and "Olive Oil, Mineral Water, Spaghetti".

Business Implications: Providing insights into customer purchasing behavior and suggesting strategies for cross-selling, product placement, and targeted promotions.

Key Concepts Explained
The Association Rules.ipynb and Association Rules.docx files also cover important theoretical aspects of Association Rule Mining, including:

Lift: A measure of how much more likely the consequent is purchased when the antecedent is purchased, relative to its overall popularity. It helps identify truly interesting rules.

Support: The frequency of an itemset in the dataset.

Confidence: How often the consequent appears in transactions that contain the antecedent.

Limitations and Challenges: Discusses common issues like computational complexity, spurious rules, data sparsity, interpretation challenges, and temporal aspects.

How to Run the Notebook
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>

Navigate to the project directory:

cd <project_directory>

Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

pip install pandas mlxtend openpyxl

(Note: openpyxl is needed to read .xlsx files if you use the original Excel file instead of the CSV.)

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook "Association Rules.ipynb"

Run all cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis.
